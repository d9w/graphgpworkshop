Given the positive outcome of the tutorial, the organizers hope that the first workshop on graph-based GP at GECCO’23 will be an opportunity to promote the further development of visions and the exchange of ideas around graph-based GP.

The content of the submission must be either new original work or discuss new perspectives on recently published work. Submitting work that is in an early stage or in progress is welcomed and appreciated.
Submitted papers must not exceed 4 pages, excluding references, and must follow the GECCO style guidelines. Articles must be submitted using the GECCO submission site, using the &amp;ldquo;Workshop Paper&amp;rdquo; submission form.</description></item><item><title>Program</title><link>https://graphgp.com/2023/program/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>d9w@pm.me (Dennis Wilson)</author><guid>https://graphgp.com/2023/program/</guid><description>Program The workshop will have two invited talks on Graph-based Genetic Programming followed by a poster session of accepted workshop articles. We hope to foster interactive discussion during the poster session both in person and online using Whova and Zoom.
