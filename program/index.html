&ldquo;Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes&rdquo;
With the increased diffusion of large and diverse models, Evolutionary Model Merge is proposed as a general method that uses evolutionary techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to combine different models with diverse capabilities, using ideas similar to graph-based neural architecture search."><link rel=icon href=https://graphgp.com/favicon.ico><meta name=keywords content=" hugo  latex  theme "><meta property="og:url" content="https://graphgp.com/program/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Graph-based Genetic Programming Workshop"><meta property="og:title" content="Program"><meta property="og:description" content="Program The workshop will start with the welcome and opening by the workshop organizers, followed by an invited talk and by the oral presentations of accepted workshop articles.

B. Langdon</a></p><p>University College London, UK</p><p>Genetic programming (GP) and other types of Evolutionary Algorithms (EC)
have long been demonstrated to be
<a href=https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/generating-trust/>creative</a>.
A
<a href=https://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gp-html/langdon_jaws30.html>recently</a>
raised question
was how much are they used?
Data from the genetic programming
<a href=https://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/>bibliography</a>
for last year suggests 38¬†¬±5%
of published papers are primarily on
applications which just happen to use GP.
Many applications relate to
health, civil engineering or solid state materials,
e.g. batteries.</p><p>Lenski et al&rsquo;s studies of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment>long term evolution</a>
in biology show evolution can retain its ability
for continued change even after 75,000 generations.
Instead of 36 years,
with performance effectively exceeding a
<a href=https://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gp-html/langdon_2022_trillion.html>trillion</a>
GP operations per second,
GP experiments can be run to a
<a href=https://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gp-html/Langdon_2022_ALJ.html>million</a>
generations in weeks on a single computer.
Information theory explains why
in small populations, GP populations
<a href=https://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gp-html/langdon_GPEM_gpconv.html>converge</a>
and the rate of fitness improvement falls
as huge GP trees become more robust to crossover.</p><a href=https://gpbib.cs.ucl.ac.uk/gp-html/langdon_2024_GI.html>Mutation testing</a> on C and C++ programs show
that real software can also be robust to many source code changes.
As with lisp functional language in tree GP,
there is a tendency for deeply nested imperative code to be more robust.<p>There are already examples of
human written software systems that exceed a billion lines of
(imperative)
source code.
Information theory&rsquo;s failed disruption propagation
<a href=https://2021.esec-fse.org/details/fse-2021-ideas-visions-and-reflections/6/Software-Robustness-A-Survey-a-Theory-and-Prospects>(FDP)</a>
helps to explain why maintaining, testing and debugging
such deeply nested code repositories is hard
and why software companies prefer unit testing of modules
(each of which is typically only shallowly nested)
rather than system testing of complete functional hierarchies.
There is already SBSE work on automatically
<a href=https://doi.org/10.1145/2931037.2931062>optimizing</a> test oracles.
FDP suggests systems should be built with many densely packed
test agents so that disruption caused by bugs has
little distance to travel before being discovered by an oracle.</p><p>For evolutionary computing and artificial life
experiments aiming for sustained innovation,
we propose the use of
<a href=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Langdon/ei2024/langdon_ei2024.pdf>&ldquo;mangrove&rdquo;</a>
architectures
composed of many small trees which are intimate with their environment.
For continuous innovative evolution the fitness function needs to
be able to measure on average if genetic changes are good or not,
or at least have made a difference.
This means we must overcome robustness,
without introducing chaos.
We suggest this might be met by systems
where the bulk of the code remains close to the fitness environment
and the disruption caused by most
mutations and crossovers has only a
short depth to propagate in order to have a measurable fitness impact.</p><h2 id=oral-presentations-8-minutes-each>Oral presentations (8 minutes each)</h2><h3 id=byron-a-fuzzer-for-turing-complete-test-programs>Byron: A Fuzzer for Turing-complete Test Programs</h3><p>Marco Sacchet, Dimitri Masetta, Giovanni Squillero, Alberto Tonda</p><h3 id=directed-acyclic-program-graph-applied-to-supervised-classification>Directed Acyclic Program Graph Applied to Supervised Classification</h3><p>Thibaut Bellanger, Matthieu Le Berre, Manuel Clergue, Jin-Kao Hao</p><h3 id=on-search-trajectory-networks-for-graph-genetic-programming>On Search Trajectory Networks for Graph Genetic Programming</h3><p>Camilo De La Torre, Sylvain Cussat-Blanc, Dennis Wilson, Yuri Lavinas</p><h3 id=minimizing-the-exa-gp-graph-based-genetic-programming-algorithm-for-interpretable-time-series-forecasting>Minimizing the EXA-GP Graph-Based Genetic Programming Algorithm for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting</h3><p>Jared Murphy, Travis Desell</p></article></main><footer id=footer><div><span>¬© 2022</span> - <span>2025</span></div><div><span>Powered by </span><a class=link href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>
