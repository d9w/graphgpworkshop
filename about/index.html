The GECCO'22 graph-based GP tutorial launched an exchange among graph-based GP researchers.
Following this, the first edition of the Graph-based GP Workshop was held at  GECCO'23.
With over 40 participants, two invited speakers, four submissions, and three accepted posters, the GECCO'23 workshop was a success.
