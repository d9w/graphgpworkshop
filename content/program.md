# Program

The workshop will have two invited talks on Graph-based Genetic Programming followed by a poster session of accepted workshop articles. We hope to foster interactive discussion during the poster session both in person and online using Whova and Zoom.

Sunday, July 16 | Room : Madrid, F12 
------------ | ----------------
16:10 - 16:15 | **Welcome and Opening**<br/>Roman Kalkreuth, Dennis Wilson
16:15 - 16:50 | **Are Linear GP and Graph GP Close Relatives?**<br/>Wolfgang Banzhaf
16:50 - 17:25 | **Cartesian Genetic Programming in Electronic Design Automation**<br/>Lukáš Sekanina
17:25 - 18:05 | Poster session

## Invited Talks

**Are Linear GP and Graph GP Close Relatives?**<br/>
Wolfgang Banzhaf<br/>
John R. Koza Chair for Genetic Programming, Department of Computer Science and Engineering,  Michigan State University, Michigan (USA)

In this talk we shall discuss the relation between linear
and graph-based GP. While at the surface quite different
in structure and behavior the talk aims to explain their
close relationship, a recognition that can benefit both
representations. 

**Cartesian Genetic Programming in Electronic Design Automation**<br/>
Lukáš Sekanina<br/>
Professor for Computer Science, Head of Department
Evolvable Hardware Research Group. Faculty of Information Technology, Department of Computer Systems, Brno University of Technology, Brno (Czech Republic)
