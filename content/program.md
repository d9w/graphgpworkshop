# Program
The workshop will start with an introduction tutorial, followed by an invited talk and by the oral presentations of accepted workshop articles.
More details on the program will follow.

## Introductory tutorial
In this brief tutorial, participants will receive an overview of Graph-based Genetic Programming (GGP). 
The session will cover fundamental concepts, methodologies, and potential applications across different domains. 
Additionally, we will explore popular code frameworks used in GGP implementations, highlighting their key features and functionalities.

## Invited talk: "Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes"
With the increased diffusion of large and diverse models, _Evolutionary Model Merge_ is proposed as a general method that uses evolutionary techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to combine different models with diverse capabilities.
This proposition shares a lot of ideas from graph-based neural architecture search, thus its relevance in our workshop.

# Oral presentations
List of accepted papers will be announced on May 3rd, 2024.
