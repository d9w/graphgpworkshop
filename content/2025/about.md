# About

The GECCO'22 graph-based GP tutorial launched an exchange among graph-based GP researchers. 
Following this, the first edition of the Graph-based GP Workshop was held at  GECCO'23. 
With over 40 participants, two invited speakers, four submissions, and three accepted posters, the GECCO'23 workshop was a success. 
The second edition of the workshop, held at GECCO'24, was a similar success, with an hybrid format featuring two invited speakers and four accepted short papers (oral presentations).
Continuing this workshop at GECCO'25  would promote the further the development of and the exchange of ideas around graph-based GP.
