While the classical way to represent programs in Genetic Programming (GP) is using an expression tree, different GP variants with graph-based representations have been proposed. Graph-based representations have led to novel applications of GP in circuit design, cryptography, image analysis, and more. This workshop aims to encourage this form of GP by considering graph-based methods from a unified perspective and to bringing together researchers in this subfield of GP research.

The Graph-based GP Workshop will be held at [GECCO 20254](https://gecco-2025.sigevo.org/Workshops) in MÃ¡laga in July 2025.
