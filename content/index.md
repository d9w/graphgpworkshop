While the classical way to represent programs in Genetic Programming (GP) is using an expression tree, different GP variants with graph-based representations have been proposed and studied throughout the years. Graph-based representations have led to novel applications of GP in circuit design, cryptography, image analysis, and more. This workshop aims to encourage this form of GP by considering graph-based methods from a unified perspective and to bring together researchers in this subfield of GP research. \\

We invite submissions that present recent developments in graph-based Genetic Programming. Submitting work that is in an early stage or in progress is welcomed and appreciated.

## Scope

The scope of the workshop includes the following GGP related topics and issues, but is not limited to: 

 +  Genetic operators
 +  Representation models
 +  Theoretical results
 +  Applications
 +  Implementations
 +  Search and runtime performance 
 +  Hyperparameter optimization
 +  Benchmarking 
 +  Self adaption
 +  Phenotye space and semantic analysis 
 +  Fitness landscape analysis
