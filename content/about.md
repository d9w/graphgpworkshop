# About

The GECCO'22 graph-based GP tutorial launched an exchange among graph-based GP researchers. 
Following this, the first edition of the Graph-based GP Workshop was held at  GECCO'23. 
With over 40 participants, two invited speakers, four submissions, and three accepted posters, the GECCO'23 workshop was a success. 
We hope that continuing this workshop at GECCO'24 will promote the further the development of and the exchange of ideas around graph-based GP.
