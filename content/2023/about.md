# About

The GECCO’22 graph-based GP tutorial launched an exchange among graph-based GP researchers. Given the positive outcome of the tutorial, the organizers hope that the first workshop on graph-based GP at GECCO’23 will be an opportunity to promote the further development of visions and the exchange of ideas around graph-based GP.
