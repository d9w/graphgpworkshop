Given the positive outcome of the tutorial, the organizers hope that the first workshop on graph-based GP at GECCO’23 will be an opportunity to promote the further development of visions and the exchange of ideas around graph-based GP.

More details on the program will follow.
Introductory tutorial In this brief tutorial, participants will receive an overview of Graph-based Genetic Programming (GGP). The session will cover fundamental concepts, methodologies, and potential applications across different domains. Additionally, we will explore popular code frameworks used in GGP implementations, highlighting their key features and functionalities.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://graphgp.com/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>d9w@pm.me (Dennis Wilson)</author><guid>https://graphgp.com/about/</guid><description>About The GECCO'22 graph-based GP tutorial launched an exchange among graph-based GP researchers. Following this, the first edition of the Graph-based GP Workshop was held at GECCO'23. With over 40 participants, two invited speakers, four submissions, and three accepted posters, the GECCO'23 workshop was a success. We hope that continuing this workshop at GECCO'24 will promote the further the development of and the exchange of ideas around graph-based GP.
