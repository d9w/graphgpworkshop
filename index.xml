Graph-based representations have led to novel applications of GP in circuit design, cryptography, image analysis, and more. This workshop aims to encourage this form of GP by considering graph-based methods from a unified perspective and to bring together researchers in this subfield of GP research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Graph-based GP Workshop will be held at &lt;a href="https://gecco-2023.sigevo.org/Workshops">GECCO 2023&lt;/a> in Lisbon in July 15-19, 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scope">Scope&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We invite &lt;a href="https://graphgp.com/cfp/">submissions&lt;/a> that present recent developments in graph-based Genetic Programming. The scope of the workshop includes the following topics and issues as they relate to graph-based GP:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Genetic operators&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Representation models&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Theoretical results&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implementations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search and runtime performance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hyperparameter optimization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Benchmarking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self adaption&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Phenotye space and semantic analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fitness landscape analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
